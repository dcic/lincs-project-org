## Centers

The LINCS program is implemented in two parts: pilot phase 1 (FY 2010) and the continuation of the program in production phase 2. This part of the program consists primarily of LINCS Data and Signature Generation Centers. Phase 2 will also synergize with the efforts of the NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) program.

### LINCS Production Phase 2

#### LINCS Data and Signature Generation Centers

The LINCS Data and Signature Generation Centers are six research centers focused on high-throughput experiments that examine the changes that occur when a variety of different cell lines are exposed to perturbations.

#### BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center

The BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) is the data coordination center for the NIH Common Fund’s Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program, which aims to characterize how a variety of types of cells, tissues and networks respond to disruption by drugs and other factors. The center supports data science research focusing on interpreting and integrating LINCS-generated data from different data types and databases in the LINCS-funded projects. This center is co-funded by BD2K and the NIH Common Fund.

The organizational structure of the Center includes a strong Consortium Coordination and Administration (CCA) that supports and manages the Center’s goals and deliverables, and coordinates activities across the LINCS and BD2K programs.

* Project Title: Data Coordination and Integration Center for LINCS-BD2K (1U54HL127624)
* Principal Investigators: Avi Ma’ayan PhD, Mario Medvedovic PhD, Stephan Schurer PhD
* Awardee Institution: Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai
* Press Release: NIH invests almost $32 million to increase utility of biomedical research data
* Center Website: lincs-dcic.org

The Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) for the Library of Integrated Network-based Signatures (LINCS) program consists of four major components:

* Integrated Knowledge Environment (IKE): The Center is constructing a high-capacity scalable IKE enabling federated access, intuitive querying and integrative analysis and visualization across all LINCS resources and many additional external data types from other relevant resources. The IKE resources are built on the infrastructure, analysis tools and data that we have already established in the LINCS pilot and transition phases.
* Data Science Research (DSR): The DCIC performs, supports and funds several internal and external data science research projects, addressing various data integration and intracellular molecular regulatory network challenges.
* Community Training and Outreach (CTO): The CTO efforts of the DCIC established several educational resources including a LINCS MOOC and a summer research training program. In addition, the DCIC is initiating and supporting diverse collaborative projects that leverage LINCS resources and disseminate LINCS data and tools.
* Consortium Coordination and Administration (CCA): The organizational structure of the Center includes a strong CCA that supports and manages the Center’s goals and deliverables, and coordinates activities across the LINCS and BD2K programs.

The Center brings together a team of computational experts with several years of experience with LINCS data and complementary expertise: Drs. Ma’ayan, Schürer, and Medvedovic develop and deploy a next generation computational infrastructure, develop novel analysis tools and methods enabling researchers to glean new insights from integrative models of biological systems to link complex diseases/phenotypes with drugs and the pathways that those drugs target in different cells and tissues. The DCIC plays a key role in realizing the transformative potential of LINCS data and resources in accelerating the discovery of novel therapeutics and improving diagnostics of human health.

### LINCS Pilot Phase 1 (Fiscal Year Completion 2013)

The LINCS Pilot Phase 1 was composed of 10 centers: two data production/analysis centers, that generated data for the LINCS matrix, four centers dedicated to developing technology to complement and facilitate the collection of cellular signatures, and four centers that developed computational tools for analyzing the data produced by the data production centers. In addition, two external supplements, as well as a number of internal collaborations, supported and augmented the work done by the LINCS centers.

### Data and Signature Generation Centers

Building on a successful pilot project, the National Institutes of Health has awarded grants to six research institutions to establish centers, collectively called the Data and Signature Generation Centers. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), both part of NIH, administer the program on behalf of the NIH Common Fund.

#### Drug Toxicity Signature Generation Center (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai)

The Drug Toxicity Signature Generation Center aims to develop cell signatures that will predict adverse events that might be caused by drugs and will identify other drugs that might lessen these side effects. The center will leverage the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System database to identify drugs that produce adverse events in heart, liver and neuronal function, and to search for drugs that may mitigate these events.

#### HMS LINCS Center (Harvard Medical School)

The HMS LINCS Center develops new measurement methods and computer algorithms to detect and analyze perturbations induced by therapeutic drugs in healthy and diseased human cells.

#### LINCS Center for Transcriptomics (Broad Institute)

The LINCS Center for Transcriptomics is studying up to 50 cell types perturbed by a large number of chemical compounds and genetic reagents that activate or deactivate genes. Each perturbation will produce about 1,000 gene-expression readouts. By the project’s end, the center expects to have generated more than 1 million profiles of how genes are expressed in different cells.

#### LINCS Proteomic Characterization Center for Signaling and Epigenetics (Broad Institute)

The LINCS Proteomic Characterization Center for Signaling and Epigenetics studies cell disruption at the most basic levels: phosphorylation-mediated signaling — that is, how cells communicate internally; and epigenetics, or how cells perpetuate non-genetic information as they grow.

#### Microenvironment Perturbagen (MEP) LINCS Center (Oregon Health and Science University)
The MEP LINCS Center studies how both malignant and non-malignant cells are controlled by the microenvironments in which they live. The researchers will provide measurements of the impacts of thousands of different microenvironments on cellular phenotypes, protein make-up and gene expression readouts in cell lines.

#### NeuroLINCS Center (University of California, Irvine)

The NeuroLINCS Center concentrates on human brain cells, which are far less understood than other cells in the body. The researchers believe it will be necessary to study these cell types directly to understand the causes of neurological disease and to develop new therapies. By applying LINCS-type perturbations to studying an array of human brain cells, the researchers hope to identify targets for developing drugs against neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease), spinal muscular atrophy and Huntington’s disease.
