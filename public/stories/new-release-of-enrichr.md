Updated ChEA library, new LINCS L1000 libraries and Harmonizome Mobile App

In this new release of [Enrichr](http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/), the BD2K-LINCS DCIC updated their [ChIP-X Enrichment Analysis (ChEA)](http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/lib/chea.jsp) database with gene sets extracted from forty new studies. The previous version is now in the ‘Legacy’ category for provenance.

They also added a new gene set library created from the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes ([dbGaP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap)), as well as two new libraries with the up- and down-regulated genes from the L1000 Connectivity Map chemical perturbation profiles from the [LINCS Center for Transcriptomics](http://www.lincscloud.org/). The previous version of the Connectivity Map Affymetrix data was renamed to Old CMAP.

Please visit the ‘[What’s New?](http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/#new)‘ section of the Enrichr website for more details about the new release.
