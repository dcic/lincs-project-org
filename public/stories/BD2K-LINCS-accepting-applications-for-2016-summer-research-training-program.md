The [BD2K-LINCS DCIC Summer Research Training Program in Biomedical Big Data Science](http://lincs-dcic.org/#/summer-research-app#nav) is a research intensive ten-week training program for undergraduate and graduate students interested in participating in cutting edge research projects aimed at solving data-intensive biomedical problems. [Summer fellows](http://lincs-dcic.org/#/summer-fellows-2015#nav) conduct faculty-mentored independent research projects within laboratories affiliated with the Center in the following areas: data integration, dynamic data visualization, machine learning, data harmonization, computational drug discovery, metadata and APIs, knowledge modeling, Bayesian networks and statistical mining.

In summer session 2016, our research training program will be offered at the three sites affiliated with our NIH-funded Center:

[Maâ€™ayan Laboratory of Computational Systems Biology](http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/labs/maayan-laboratory) | Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai

[Medvedovic Laboratory for Statistical Genomics and Systems Biology](http://eh3.uc.edu/) | University of Cincinnati

[Schurer Laboratory in the Center for Computational Science](http://ccs.miami.edu/focus-area/drug-discovery/) | University of Miami

**Application Deadline: March 4, 2016 at 11:00 PM ET**
