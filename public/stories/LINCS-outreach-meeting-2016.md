The Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program aims to create a network-based understanding of biology by cataloging changes induced by exogenous perturbations on cellular processes through the lens of molecular and morphological profiling signatures. By generating, integrating, and publically releasing data and tools that indicate how cells respond to various genetic and environmental stressors, the LINCS project will help us gain a more detailed understanding of cell pathways and aid efforts to develop therapies that might restore perturbed pathways and networks to their normal states. Come join us at our first ever Outreach Meeting to see examples of LINCS in action and learn how to effectively work with these unprecedented data sets.
