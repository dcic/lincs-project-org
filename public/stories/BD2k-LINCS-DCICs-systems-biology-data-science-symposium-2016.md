On January 19-20, 2016, the first annual Systems Biology Data Science Symposium (SBDSS 2016) at the University of Miami brought together the BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center, local researchers, and outside experts who apply or develop computational systems biology resources. In presentations, a poster reception and several working sessions, the DCIC showcased tools/resources and scientific projects, connected developers with users, and initiated new collaborations.
