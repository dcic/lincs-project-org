The overarching goal of the Broad Institute’s LINCS program is the development of comprehensive signatures of cellular states that can be used by the entire research community to understand protein function, small-molecule action, physiological states and disease states. Our center will create the world’s most comprehensive resource of perturbational signatures. This will include 1.4 million L1000 genetic (CRISPER knock-out, shRNA knock-down and ORF overexpression) and small-molecule (drug and tool compound) perturbations spanning 50 cell types of varied lineage. We will make it possible for biologists and computational scientists worldwide to interact with the data by creating user-friendly apps that are designed to facilitate biological discovery.
