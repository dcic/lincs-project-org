Access to and utilization of LINCS resources by the biomedical and data science research communities is one of the major aims of the LINCS program. The [BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center](http://lincs-dcic.org/#/), together with the [data and signature generation centers](/centers), use approaches like webinars, courses, training seminars, challenges, workshops and symposia to create an active LINCS community.

### Data Science Research Collaborations with the BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center

[Request for Applications](http://lincs-dcic.org/#/edsr#nav): The [BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC)](http://bd2k-lincs.org/#/) is soliciting applications from the scientific community for data science research collaborations with the DCIC that focus on mining and integrating data generated by the LINCS program for new scientific discovery. The overarching goal of this solicitation is to maximize the value of LINCS data and transform it into new knowledge. The DCIC, via a subcontract, will support collaboration projects with a budget limit of $130K in total costs per year for up to two years.

# LINCS Consortium Meetings

Each year a meeting is held by, and for, the [Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) Consortium](https://commonfund.nih.gov/LINCS/index). The purpose of these meetings is to gather members of the LINCS consortium to present research efforts and plans, and to work along with NIH program staff to continue to develop a successful LINCS program.

## 2015 Consortium Meeting

<img src="docs/LINCS/img/lincs_f2f_2015-300x182.png" style="float: right; margin: 16px;">

The 2015 LINCS Consortium Meeting was held September 24-25, at the National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD.

**DAY 1, Thursday, September 24: Center Presentations and E-poster Session**

Two of the primary goals of Day 1 were to (i) to enhance collaboration among LINCS Centers and ensure timely completion of the first “dense cube” projects and (ii) to identify data analysis challenges and data/metadata/database bottlenecks.

* [BD2K-LINCS DCIC](docs/DCIC): Advancing the LINCS program through data integration, tool development, research projects and outreach
* [DToxS](docs/DToxS): Integrated analysis of transcriptional signatures of cardiotoxicity resulting from kinase inhibition
* [HMS LINCS](docs/HMS-LINCS): Fundamental principles of cellular response to perturbation
* [LINCS Center for Transcriptomics](docs/LINCS-Transcriptomics)
* [LINCS PCCSE](docs/LINCS-Proteomics): Proteomic connectivity maps of signaling and epigenetics
* [MEP LINCS](docs/MEP): High-throughput image-based assessment of cellular phenotypes modulated by microenvironment perturbagens
* [NeuroLINCS](docs/NeuroLINCS)

**DAY 2, Friday, September 25: Joint Activities and Technologies**

The goals of Day 2 were to (i) highlight joint activities of LINCS Data and Signature Generation Centers (DSGCs) and DCIC and (ii) to articulate suggestions for future improvement.
