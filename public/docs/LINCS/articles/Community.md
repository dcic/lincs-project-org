Access to and utilization of LINCS resources by the biomedical and data science research communities is one of the major aims of the LINCS program. The [BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center](http://lincs-dcic.org/#/), together with the [data and signature generation centers](/centers), use approaches like webinars, courses, training seminars, challenges, workshops and symposia to create an active LINCS community.
