The LINCS program is implemented in two parts: pilot phase 1 (FY 2010) and the continuation of the program in production phase 2. This part of the program consists primarily of LINCS Data and Signature Generation Centers. Phase 2 will also synergize with the efforts of the NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) program.

# LINCS production phase 2

## LINCS data and signature generation centers

The LINCS Data and Signature Generation Centers are six research centers focused on high-throughput experiments that examine the changes that occur when a variety of different cell lines are exposed to perturbations.

## BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center

The BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) is the data coordination center for the NIH Common Fund’s Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program, which aims to characterize how a variety of types of cells, tissues and networks respond to disruption by drugs and other factors. The center supports data science research focusing on interpreting and integrating LINCS-generated data from different data types and databases in the LINCS-funded projects. This center is co-funded by BD2K and the NIH Common Fund.

The organizational structure of the Center includes a strong Consortium Coordination and Administration (CCA) that supports and manages the Center’s goals and deliverables, and coordinates activities across the LINCS and BD2K programs.

## LINCS pilot phase 1 (fiscal year completion 2013)

The LINCS Pilot Phase 1 was composed of 10 centers: two data production/analysis centers, that generated data for the LINCS matrix, four centers dedicated to developing technology to complement and facilitate the collection of cellular signatures, and four centers that developed computational tools for analyzing the data produced by the data production centers. In addition, two external supplements, as well as a number of internal collaborations, supported and augmented the work done by the LINCS centers.
