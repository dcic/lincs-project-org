The Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) for the Library of Integrated Network-based Signatures (LINCS) program consists of four major components:

* **Integrated Knowledge Environment (IKE)**: The Center is constructing a high-capacity scalable IKE enabling federated access, intuitive querying and integrative analysis and visualization across all LINCS resources and many additional external data types from other relevant resources. The IKE resources are built on the infrastructure, [analysis tools](http://lincs-dcic.org/#/resources) and data that we have already established in the LINCS pilot and transition phases.
* **Data Science Research (DSR)**: The DCIC performs, supports and funds several internal and external data science research projects, addressing various data integration and intracellular molecular regulatory network challenges.
* **Community Training and Outreach (CTO)**: The CTO efforts of the DCIC established several educational resources including a LINCS MOOC and a summer research training program. In addition, the DCIC is initiating and supporting diverse collaborative projects that leverage LINCS resources and disseminate LINCS data and tools.
* **Consortium Coordination and Administration (CCA)**: The organizational structure of the Center includes a strong CCA that supports and manages the Center’s goals and deliverables, and coordinates activities across the LINCS and BD2K programs.
