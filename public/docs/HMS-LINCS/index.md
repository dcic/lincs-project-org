* Project Title: [Pharmaco-Response Signatures and Disease Mechanisms (1U54HL127365)](http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_description.cfm?projectnumber=1U54HL127365-01)
* Principal Investigator: [Peter Sorger PhD](http://sorger.med.harvard.edu/people/peter-sorger-phd/)
* Awardee Institution: [Harvard Medical School](http://hms.harvard.edu/)
* Center Website: [HMS LINCS Center](http://lincs.hms.harvard.edu/)

**Goals**: The overall goal of the HMS LINCS Center is to delineate the fundamental principles of cellular response to perturbagens – clinical grade kinase inhibitors and components of the cellular microenvironment in particular – at the level of single-cells and cell populations and to make response data routinely available along with web-based *browse, query and programmatic* tools. The Center develops, tests and applies diverse measurement and computational methods and uses these to create response signatures for normal and diseased human cells exposed to perturbations individually and in combination. We emphasize systematic collection of data not currently available in public databases including live and fixed-cell imaging, biochemical data on signaling proteins and multi-factorial drug-response phenotypes. In pursuit of this goal, we also help to develop metadata standards and informatics systems for these types of data.

**Approaches**: The collection of multiplex perturbagen-response data at HMS involves the use of complementary assays including imaging, flow cytometry, sandwich immunoassays, protein mass spectrometry and mRNA profiling as a means to measure the levels, localization and states of modification of proteins targeted by perturbagens and the networks in which these proteins are embedded. Systematic analysis of this data yields the most fundamental measure of cellular response to perturbation: the dose-response relationship. Construction of perturbagen-response signatures using statistical modeling, network inference and machine learning creates models predictive of responses by genetically diverse cells to specific perturbations. Customized query, browse and explore functions developed in collaboration with the BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center, and grounded in established ontologies and standards, will make it possible to access [HMS LINCS data](http://lincs.hms.harvard.edu/db/) and manipulate it programmatically.

**Outcomes**: The Center’s research will provide a comprehensive picture of the responses of cells and tissues to some of the most important classes of therapeutic molecules (kinase inhibitors and chromatin targeting drugs) and the extent to which these responses vary with changes in the solid-phase and soluble components of the microenvironment. We aim to characterize variation in the biochemistry of cell signaling pathways under basal and perturbed conditions and then explain the origins of this variation in precise molecular terms. By comparing perturbagen-response across tissue types and disease we will not only uncover fundamental properties of cell signaling networks, we will identify opportunities for drug repurposing. We expect repurposing of cancer drugs for cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases to represent a particularly significant opportunity. By directly comparing perturbagen-responses in diseased and normal cells, including cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, kidney epithelia, neurons, and immune cells we will increase our understanding of toxic responses and develop means for efficiently scoring the potential therapeutic index of new drugs. Finally, by creating predictive models of drug response for different tissue niches we hope to improve our ability to personalize therapies to the needs of individual patients and to increase the durability of existing treatments.
