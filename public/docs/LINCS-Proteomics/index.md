The LINCS Proteomic Characterization Center for Signaling and Epigenetics, under the direction of Dr. Jacob D. Jaffe of the Broad Institute, tests the hypothesis that early modulation of signaling events in response to perturbations can establish new cellular states by altering their epigenetic landscapes. Using cutting-edge mass spectrometry-based proteomics assays, the center broadly profiles cellular responses in the spaces of phosphosignaling and histone modifications (epigenetic “marks”) in a highly multiplexed manner. The center focuses on perturbing genes and pathways in foundational biology systems (such as cancer cell lines) and in neurobiological cellular differentiation paradigms (under direction of co-investigator [Dr. Li-Huei Tsai](http://lihueitsai.org/) of MIT). Next-generation proteomic data acquisition and analysis strategies to support these activities are being developed in the laboratory of [Dr. Michael MacCoss](https://sites.google.com/a/uw.edu/maccoss/) of the University of Washington.
