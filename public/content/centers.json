The center will leverage the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System database to identify drugs that produce adverse events in heart, liver and neuronal function, and to search for drugs that may mitigate these events."

Each perturbation will produce about 1,000 gene-expression readouts. By the project’s end, the center expects to have generated more than 1 million profiles of how genes are expressed in different cells."

The researchers believe it will be necessary to study these cell types directly to understand the causes of neurological disease and to develop new therapies. By applying LINCS-type perturbations to studying an array of human brain cells, the researchers hope to identify targets for developing drugs against neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease), spinal muscular atrophy and Huntington’s disease."

The Center is constructing a high-capacity scalable integrated knowledge environment enabling federated access, intuitive querying and integrative analysis and visualization across all LINCS resources and many additional external data types from other relevant resources. The Center’s data science research projects are aimed at addressing various data integration and intracellular molecular regulatory network challenges. The Center aims to develop: 1) methods to connect cellular and organismal phenotypes with molecular cellular signatures, and 2) novel data visualization methods for dynamically interacting with large-genomics and proteomics datasets."
